# Brain Tumor Classification 🧠🔍

This project is dedicated to creating a system that detects and classifies brain tumors at an early stage using a combination of image processing techniques and deep learning. Recognizing the life-threatening implications of brain tumors, early detection plays a pivotal role in lessening the impact and potentially saving lives. The system utilizes diverse image processing technologies to preprocess a dataset of MRI images, priming it for effective model training.

## Objectives 🎯
- Implementing different **image processing techniques**.
- Developing a **classification system** for various types of brain tumors to reduce fatalities.
- Providing a tool to assist doctors in the analysis and diagnosis of brain tumors.

## Steps 🚀
1. **Image Acquisition**
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Conversion to grayscale
   - Noise removal
   - Brightness adjustment
   - Morphological operations
3. **Data Augmentation**
4. **Modeling:**
   - Using a pre-trained model.

## Pretrained Model Used 🤖
VGG-16

## The Dataset 📊
This dataset comprises 7023 images of human brain MRI images classified into 4 classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. You can access the dataset on Kaggle: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

## Tools 🛠️
Several libraries were used, including:
- OpenCV
- OS
- Numpy
- Imutils
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- scikit-learn
Main language: **Python**

## Results 📈
The system achieved an accuracy of up to 97% for testing and 98% for training using the VGG-16 pre-trained model, making it a promising tool for aiding in the early detection and classification of brain tumors.
